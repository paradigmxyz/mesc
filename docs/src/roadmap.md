# Roadmap

Once the MESC specification reaches version 1.0, it will become ossified forever. This will maximize forward- and backward-compatibility between MESC integrations. Client libraries for reading or writing MESC configurations might continue development, but the underlying MESC specification will not change.

MESC currently has implementations for CLI, python, and rust. Implementations for go and typescript are coming soon. If there is another language you have interest in bringing MESC to an additional programming language or environment, feel free to share on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/mesc).
